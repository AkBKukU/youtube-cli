# Youtube CLI
Primarily for uploading. Maybe other stuff eventually


## What can this do?
(WIP) Upload videos


## Installation
You will need [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [google api](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/installation) 
installed. You will also need to get a [Google API key](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862) 
to access the Youtube API servers. Once you have a `client_id` and 
`client_secret` to put in the `apikey-empty.py` file and add your channel id 
(it's the non-custom version of your channel url link) you should be ready. Then 
rename it to `apikey.py`.

The code is written in python and is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux.
I'll have more detailed installation instructions as I continue to improve the 
program.
